Very frustrated from my morning chill-out set, I thought maybe an hour night psy will cheer my mood up (I'm not familiar enough with CDJs to get good enough transitions for my taste, so I avoid Ping-Pong shows). Really nice to see so many energetic dancing people, was a nice flight for me as well :)
