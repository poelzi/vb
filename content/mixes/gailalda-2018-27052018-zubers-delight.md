Ingredients:
- 1 Zuber
- 400 Liters of warm water
- 1 PA
- 1 to 15 humans
- psydub *

(*) may contain bad mixing and autodj depending on dj mood

Time constrained and exhausted, I did not really have time for playing on the zuber floor until Sunday. As I wanted to spend the time inside the zuber and not behind the mixer, the autodj was hailed to the rescue ;)

This mix was made afterwards. As the track selection was more or less done in 15 minutes, it's not particular mix friendly...
