Kidsspace @34c3 - grown up kids occupy the nightly realms. Driving bobby cars and building towers from over-sized legos. Due the lack of proper soundtrack, this mix emerged spontaneously through the help of the high jacked PA.
I think the tower was completed around ~ 50 - 60 minutes playtime - fitted very nicely with the final assembly (they build a huge helping construction from tables to move the upper part onto the base.). I remember playing Sentient - Zukunft some minutes after the tower was destroyed ( too phallistic for kidsspace in the eyes of the builders...)
As the congress started to get more alive, the mix turned into more progressive and alive sounds. Fitted very well with the atmosphere there, even a kid danced ^^
