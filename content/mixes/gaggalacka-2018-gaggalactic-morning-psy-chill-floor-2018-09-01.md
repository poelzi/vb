Early sunrise on the chill/thrill/kill floor of the Gaggalacka Festival.

I was booked for a psybreaks set, but found it to dense and breaky for early morning moods. I changed after 20 minutes to zenonesque/progressive morning psy - sorry for those who expected psybreaks. Maybe next time in the early evening :)
