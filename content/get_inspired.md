Support the artist you like, buy their music :)

[bandcamp profile](https://bandcamp.com/poelzi) - music I like and support. I stopped buying downloads from other pages until they stop charging extra for flac and give proper preview (no snippets !). Sorry, bandwith is cheap and I pay for the work, not for encoder settings.

Also [Ektoplazm](http://www.ektoplazm.com/) is a great source of music. If you like a release you will very often find the release on bandcamp, so you can donate to your artist.
