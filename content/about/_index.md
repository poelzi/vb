![blue voxels][1]

voxel.blue is normaly known as [poelzi](http://poelzi.org)

All sets are first takes, unedited¹ live mixes, done on various occasions. I usually don't have preplanned playlists for my sets, rather they manifest a particular idea or direction I had in mind. I do however collect tracks I absolutely want to play, but most tracks are chosen in midair …

¹ except normalization and maybe cutting garbage from end/beginning :)

#### Current tools used

* Thinkpad T470p - [Nixos](http://nixos.org) + Low Latency Setup
* [Mixxx](http://mixxx.org) - my integration branch [integration](https://github.com/poelzi/mixxx/tree/integration)
* [Allen & Heath XONE:K2](http://www.allen-heath.com/ahproducts/xonek2/) super compact 4 channel dj mixer with good DAC. Custom mapping. (I prefer traveling light)
* [Midi Fighter Twister](https://store.djtechtools.com/products/midi-fighter-twister) used for effects mostly.
* [Shure SRH940](https://www.shure.com/americas/products/headphones/srh940-professional-reference-headphones) Absolutely amazing detailed sound in an absolutely crappy casing. My Frankenshures have the headband of a ISK HP2011.
