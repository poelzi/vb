All sets a first takes, undedited¹ live mixes, done on various ocations. I usually don't plan my sets, rather they manifest a general idea or direction planned ahead. I do collect tracks I absolutely want to play, but most tracks a choosen in midair …

¹ except normalization and maybe cutting garbage from end/beginning :)
